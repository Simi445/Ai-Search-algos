# AI Search Algorithms 🔍

Welcome to my **AI Search Algorithms** project! This repository contains various implementations of popular search algorithms commonly used in AI and pathfinding applications, including **A\***, **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, and **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.


## 🌟 Features
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Real-time visualizations of each algorithm’s pathfinding process.
- **Interactive Grid**: Set start, end, and obstacles dynamically to explore different scenarios.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Includes A*, UCS, BFS, and Dijkstra's to compare performance and accuracy.

## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented
- **A\***: Finds the shortest path using a heuristic (like Manhattan or Euclidean distance).
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**: Ensures the lowest-cost path to the goal without heuristics.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores equally in all directions, useful for unweighted paths.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores deep and backtracks when reaches dead end.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths from a start node to all nodes in a graph.
